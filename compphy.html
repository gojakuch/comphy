      <p>
        This page is a tiny collection of examples of and special materials about computational physics. Basically, a bunch of additional (impressive) things related to computational physics that are hard to categorize any further (at least for me). Of course, this is not even 1% of all of the things that exist out there, only something I have stumbled upon and saved.

      <h2>YouTube Channels</h2>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGzuiiLdQZu9wxDNJHO_JnA">IPAM - Institute For Pure & Applied Mathematics (YouTube)</a>. This is a great actively updated channel with lecture and presentations on many topics that one can consider computational physics.
      <br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKaYxkHrmsQePZFpzF9b7sQ">Mr. P. Solver</a> is a YouTube channel with tutorials on computational physics.
      <br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm5mt-A4w61lknZ9lCsZtBw">Steve Brunton</a> is a professor of Applied Mathematics. His YouTube channel is full of both physical and computational educational materials.
      <br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq0imsn84ShAe9PBOFnoIrg">Brian Douglas</a> makes awesome lectures on Control Systems, in which you might become interested as well.
      <br> The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheJuliaLanguage">Julia Programming Language (YouTube)</a>. There happen to be some physics-related talks posted here as well.
      <br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCugBGdUbn6PeH03iPZtr-JQ">Christopher Rackauckas</a> (one of the main figures in scientific programming for Julia) used to post some talks on his YouTube. They are still interesting to watch.
      <br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheEngiineer">Jousef Murad</a> mostly posts podcasts about engineering but you ma find many of his guests and himself quite inspiring in terms of science. You may also like his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JousefMuradLITE">other channel</a>.
