      <h1>Mathematics</h1>
      <p>
        Mathematics is obviously the core of everything you will find on this website or anywhere else related to the field of Computational Physics. This page lists the minimal core topics in Mathematics that are needed to continue a successful further study (or topics that from my limited experience I consider frequently occurring). Note: it is assumed that you know high school Mathematics (trigonometry, basic algebra, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, there is a <a href="https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/TIPS_01.html#Ch1-S3">good article on mathematical prerequisite in Physics by R. Feynman.</a> (it is a part of his "Tips on Physics").
      </p>
      <h2 id="calculus">1. Basic Calculus</h2>
      <p>
        You can learn it pretty much anywhere: <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab">Khan Academy</a>, <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/">MITOCW</a>, etc. The major needed subtopics are <b>differentiation</b> and <b>integration (indefinite and simple definite)</b>. It is recommended to understand the underlying principles by also learning <b>limits</b> and <b>sequences</b>, however, these are not as common in terms of Computational Physics.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Series</b>, especially <b>Taylor Series</b> deserve special attention. It is a very frequently used formula, so you better get the intuition for it:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://youtu.be/3d6DsjIBzJ4">Taylor Series by "3Blue1Brown" (YouTube)</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://youtu.be/HQsZG8Yxb7w">Taylor Series by "Physics with Elliot" (YouTube)</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor Series on Wikipedia</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2 id="linalg">2. Linear Algebra</h2>
      <p>
        Again, any source will pass: <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL221E2BBF13BECF6C">MITOCW</a> and <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra">Khan Academy</a> have Linear Algebra courses, although, if you have never heard about it before or have a poor intuition for it (actually, even if you just have some free time) I strongly recommend you the <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-GT3co4r2y2YErbmuJw2L5tW4Ew2O5B">3Blue1Brown "The Essence of Linear Algebra" Series</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For more experienced people, there is a playlist mostly dedicated to some advanced methods by MITOCW - <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63oMNUHXqIUcrkS2PivhN3k">Matrix Methods in Data Analysis</a>. It is going to be mentioned again on other pages of this website.
      </p>
      <h2 id="multivar">3. Aspects of Multivariable Calculus</h2>
      <p>
        People (mostly Americans) also sometimes call it "Calculus III". One more time, the two best friends of mathematical self-education are courses from <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/">Khan Academy</a> and <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/">MITOCW</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want a short overview or review, I recommend the <a href="https://youtu.be/pdtb7vhxl4w">Multivariable Calculus Review by "eigenchris"</a>.
      </p>
      <h2 id="DEs">4. Differential Equations</h2>
      <p>
        Another <i>crucial</i> area of Mathematics that one needs to master for Computational Physics. <b>Differential equations</b> are mentioned so often in so many different forms that it is better to love them. In fact, many sections of this website, with rare exceptions, could be renamed to "Differential Equations" entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
        For begginers, there is a <a href="https://youtu.be/p_di4Zn4wz4">nice series of videos by 3Blue1Brown</a> again (unfortunately, there's no playlist so the link is to the first chapter only).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are the classic <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/find-by-topic/#cat=mathematics&subcat=differentialequations">MITOCW</a> and <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-equations">Khan Academy</a> links. You will probably figure out what else do you need.
      </p>
      <h2 id="probability">5. Probability Theory</h2>
      <p>
        Oh, I almost forgot! There's also Probability Theory that you should at least be aware of. Richard Feynman has written a <a href="https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_06.html">great introduction to that</a>. Besides some basic formulas, I suggest to understand the <a href="https://youtu.be/HZGCoVF3YvM">Bayes' Rule</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/YXLVjCKVP7U">distributions</a> (the more you understand about probability distributions the better).
